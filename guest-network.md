Welcome to our home network! We're happy to share our Wi-Fi connection with our guests, but we ask that you please read and agree to the following terms of use before connecting:

1. Access to our Wi-Fi network is provided as a courtesy and is not a right. We reserve the right to deny access to anyone at any time for any reason.
2. This network is intended for guest use only. You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your connection. Please do not use this network for illegal or inappropriate activities, such as accessing illegal content, engaging in online harassment or bullying, or violating copyright laws.
3. We ask that you please be considerate of others who may also be using our network. Please do not use an excessive amount of bandwidth, such as downloading large files or streaming high-definition video, as this may slow down the network for others.
4. Our network is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, and we are not responsible for any damage or loss that may occur as a result of using our network.
5. Please do not share the network password with anyone else, or allow anyone else to connect to the network without our permission.
6. We cannot guarantee the security of the network, so it is strongly recommended that you use your own virtual private network (VPN) for added security.
7. We reserve the right to disconnect any user who violates these terms of use, or who we believe may be causing harm to the network or its users.

By connecting to our network, you agree to abide by these terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not connect to our network. Thank you for your cooperation, and enjoy your stay!
