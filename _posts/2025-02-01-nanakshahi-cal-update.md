I've made some updates to the [Nanakshahi calendar ICS(https://janpreet.com/nanakshahi-calendar)]. In addition to tracking Gurpurabs, you can now also see the daily Nanakshahi date inn your calendar app, without any extra apps.

The updated calendar shows:

1. Daily Nanakshahi dates in both English and Punjabi (Gurmukhi).
2. Day of the week in both languages.
3. All Gurpurabs and historical events.
4. Nanakshahi year (NS - Nanakshahi Samvat).

The best part and my main motivation behind this update was to integrate it with iOS widgets, so you can use your phone's native app/ widget to include Nanakshahi calendar in yuor lives. No more opening separate apps or waiting for reminders from family memebers :).

If you were already subscribing to the calendar then you should have already received the updated ICS and you can check your calendar, if not here is how you can get started-

### Subscribe to the Calendar on Google Calendar
1. Open Google Calendar.
2. Click the "Add Calendar" button on the left-hand side.
3. Select "From URL" from the drop-down menu.
4. Paste [janpreet.com/nanakshahi](https://janpreet.com/nanakshahi) of the ICS file into the "URL" field.
5. Click "Add Calendar."

### Subscribe to the Calendar on Apple Calendar
1. Open the Calendar app on your Mac.
2. Choose File > New Calendar Subscription.
3. Enter the URL [janpreet.com/nanakshahi](https://janpreet.com/nanakshahi) in the "Calendar URL" field.
4. Click Subscribe.
5. Customize the settings for the calendar subscription, such as the name and color.
6. Click OK.

The calendar also syncs two years of dates, making it easier to plan ahead for important events. 
As always, special thanks to the [nanakshahi-js](https://github.com/Sarabveer/nanakshahi-js) library, that makes this possible. Let me know if you have any feedback or feature requests!
