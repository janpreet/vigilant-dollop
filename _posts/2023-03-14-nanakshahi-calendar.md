Happy 555th Sikh New Year 🎉, also 1st day of Sikh month Chet, `ਚੇਤਿ ਗੋਵਿੰਦੁ ਅਰਾਧੀਐ ਹੋਵੈ ਅਨੰਦੁ ਘਣਾ ||`. I wanted to share with you a [project](https://github.com/janpreet/nanakshahi-ical) that I've been working on recently. I have created a script that generates an ICS file for Nanakshahi dates and Sikh religious holidays. 

The reason I created this script is that I found it challenging to keep track of Gurpurabs using only my calendar app. I would often miss important Gurpurabs and would have to rely on reminders from family and friends.

Here's how you can subscribe to this calendar using the ICS URL:

### Subscribe to the Calendar on Google Calendar
1. Open Google Calendar.
2. Click the "Add Calendar" button on the left-hand side.
3. Select "From URL" from the drop-down menu.
4. Paste [janpreet.com/nanakshahi](https://janpreet.com/nanakshahi) of the ICS file into the "URL" field.
5. Click "Add Calendar."

### Subscribe to the Calendar on Apple Calendar
1. Open the Calendar app on your Mac.
2. Choose File > New Calendar Subscription.
3. Enter the URL [janpreet.com/nanakshahi](https://janpreet.com/nanakshahi) in the "Calendar URL" field.
4. Click Subscribe.
5. Customize the settings for the calendar subscription, such as the name and color.
6. Click OK.

I hope this script helps you keep track of all Gurpurabs and importand Sikh holidays. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

I would like to acknowledge the [nanakshahi-js](https://github.com/Sarabveer/nanakshahi-js) library, without which this would not have been possible. I also apologize for not posting any blog posts in the last two years. I would try to be more active in the future!
