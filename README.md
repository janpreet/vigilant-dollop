# Vigilant Dollop

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog, hosted at [janpreet.com](https://janpreet.com).

## About

This blog is a space where I share my thoughts, insights, and experiences on various topics, ranging from technology and programming to personal reflections and more. Built using Jekyll, a simple and static site generator, the blog is designed to be fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

The name of this repository, "Vigilant Dollop," was a fun and random suggestion from GitHub, and it doesn’t hold any specific meaning. The content here is what truly matters—an evolving collection of ideas and writings that reflect my journey and interests.
