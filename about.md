When I'm not behind a computer screen, you can find me out and about with my wife and our corgi puppy, exploring scenic routes, discovering new breakfast spots, and of course, going on long drives. Here, I hope to share my experiences and what I've learned so far, in the hopes of inspiring others to pursue their own passions.
