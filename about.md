<br />ੴ ॥ ਏਹਿ ਭਿ ਦਾਤਿ ਤੇਰੀ ਦਾਤਾਰ ॥ Hello there 👋 I'm a self-taught tech enthusiast with a passion for video games, Bollywood movies, cooking up delicious vegetarian meals, and tinkering with home automation. When I'm not behind a computer screen, you can find me out and about with my wife and our corgi puppy, exploring scenic routes, discovering new breakfast spots, and of course, going on long drives. Here, I hope to share my experiences and what I've learned so far, in the hopes of inspiring others to pursue their own passions. Thank you for visiting!"
